## Project Overview: Automated Parking System
In this project, we will build a system that detects the presence of a vehicle using an ultrasonic sensor and controls a barrier gate using a relay. This system will help you grasp fundamental embedded concepts such as sensor interfacing, relay control, serial communication, and state machine implementation.
